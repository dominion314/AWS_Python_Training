I. Basics

Regions>Availability Zones>Data Centers>Edge and Point of Prescence.

Good to have 3 discrete data centers in each AZ. Max is 6, min is 2. AZ's 
are connected with high bandwidth ultra-low latency networks. 

Global services - IAM, Route53, CloudFront, WAF
Regional services - EC2, Lambda

II. EC2

Infratructure as a Service, renting virtual machines called Elastic Compute Cloud. 
You can rent VM's w/EC2, store data in EBS (Elastic Block Storage), load balance traffic with ELB (Elastic Load Balancing), 
and scale services with ASG (Auto Scaling Group).

Sizing and Configuration includes OS, CPU, RAM, storage - network storage will use EBS and EFS (Elastic File Server) and hardware storage will use
EC2 instance store. Finally, theres also Networking, Secruity groups, firewall rules, and bootstrap script options.

t2.micro instances allow for 750 free hours of use. 

III. IAM Permissions

Password policies can be set according to: minimum password length, require specifc character types, require password change over time, prevent password re-use. 
MFA - Multifactor Authentication, you want to preotect your root accounts and IAM users. MFA = password you know + security device you own.

Main benefit of MFA is if a password is stolen the account is not compromised. 
Your MFA options: Virtual MFA device (Googel Authenticator or Authy) - These support multiple tokens for a single device, one for phone, laptop, ipad, etc. 
    The second option is a U2F Univerversial 2nd Factor Security Key. Or a hardware key fob MFA device. And finally a AWS GovCloud Hardware key gob MFA device.
